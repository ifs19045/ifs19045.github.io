          The SAP implementation project at Abadi Agrosindo Persada is an SAP S/4HANA system in the RISE with SAP model, which means it is a next-generation, cloud-based ERP solution.
          As a BASIS team member in the SAP S/4HANA implementation project at Abadi Agrosindo Persada, I am responsible for supporting clients throughout the implementation process by handling technical tasks, such as generating SAP health reports, performing system installations and upgrades, managing system monitoring, and providing training to clients on security and BASIS management.
          All these tasks aim to ensure the SAP system runs smoothly and meets the company's operational needs.
